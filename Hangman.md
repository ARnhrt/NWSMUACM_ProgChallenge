# Hangman
### Points: 4
Write a program that will: 
- Choose a random word from a list
  - You can create your own or use these <br>
    `words = ["syndrome", "orchestra", "roof", "extract", "fill", "defeat", "snail", "plaster", "contain", "venture"]`
- Take a series of single letter inputs from a user
- Check if the letter is in that word
  - If yes, print the string with the selected letter filled in <br>
    Ex: if the word is <br>
    `Enter letter:`**`r`**<br>
    `*r*****ra`
  - If not, the player will use a life
    - The player will have 6 lives. When they run out, the game will end
- The player will win if they guess all the letters in a word
