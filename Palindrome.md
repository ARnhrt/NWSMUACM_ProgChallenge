# Palindrome Checker
### Points: 3
Create a program that will take a string as input and return `True` if a string is a palindrome (the same backwards as it is forwards) and `False` if it is not. <br>

**Example:** <br>
Input: `racecar` <br>
Output: `True` <br>
<br>
Input:  `python` <br>
Output: `False`
